Welcome to DCOS.io.  Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website (the “Website”).  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Website, please contact us at contact@dcos.io.

These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Mesosphere, Inc. (“Mesosphere,” “we” and “us”).   You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Website.  Your use of the Website in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Website.  These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the [Privacy Policy](/privacy/).

## I thought you said DC/OS was open source?

It is!  DC/OS is available under the terms of the Apache Software License, version 2.0.   Your use of DC/OS shall be governed by (and nothing in these Terms will limit your rights under) the Apache Software License, version 2.0.

## Will these Terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Website, so these Terms may need to change along with the Website.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the DCOS.io website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Website.  If you use the Website in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

## What about my privacy?

Mesosphere takes the privacy of its users very seriously.  For the current Mesosphere Privacy Policy, please [click here](/privacy/).

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13.  We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to us.  If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.  If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at contact@dcos.io.

## What are the basics of using DCOS.io?

You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Website and DC/OS and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).  If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).

You will only us the Website and DC/OS in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you.  If your use of the Website or DC/OS is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Website or DC/OS.  We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Website or DC/OS in a way that breaks the law.

## What are my rights in the Website?

The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Website, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, videos, images, illustrations, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws.  You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Website, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Mesosphere’s) rights.

You understand that Mesosphere owns the Website. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), creative derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Website.

The Website may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply.

## Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Website?

The Website may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Mesosphere. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Mesosphere is not responsible for such risks.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.

Mesosphere has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Website. In addition, Mesosphere will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Website, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found through the Website, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Mesosphere shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.

If there is a dispute between users of this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that Mesosphere is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Mesosphere, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Website. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

## Will Mesosphere ever change the Website?

We’re always trying to improve the Website, so they may change over time.  We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Website, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Website. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Website at any time, for any reason, in our sole discretion, and without notice.

## What if I want to stop using the Website?

You’re free to do that at any time; please refer to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Website.

Mesosphere is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Website, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.   Mesosphere has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.

By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.

The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  You and Mesosphere agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Mesosphere, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein).
