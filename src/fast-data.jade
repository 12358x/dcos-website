        p.hero-subtitle(style='max-width: 46rem;').mb0 &ldquo;Big data&rdquo; is collected from many sources in real-time, but is processed after collection in batches to provide information about the past. Modern apps, however, need to respond to events happening now, not to yesterday's news. To do this, they use a &ldquo;fast data&rdquo; pipeline, which processes data as it is collected to provide real-time insights.

            h2 DC/OS enables fast data
            p Fast data pipelines enable applications to do amazing things, but they also pose challenges that aren’t a problem when you’re dealing with big data alone. Building your fast data pipeline—and the app that it supports—on top of DC/OS (the datacenter operating system) can help alleviate some of these challenges.

            h4 On-demand provisioning
            p Fast data pipelines require many different services that all have different requirements and prerequisites. DC/OS schedules these services with a few clicks or commands on either CPUs or GPUs.

            h4 Simplified operations
            p When you rely on fast data, every second counts. You need your fast data pipeline to be more resilient than the infrastructure it runs on, and DC/OS provides that resiliency.

            h4 Elastic infrastructure
            p Maintaining enough infrastructure to handle data-processing peaks can be expensive. DC/OS allows you to scale up critical micro-services during peaks and schedule extra resources efficiently during troughs.

            h2.pb4.center.mx-auto How does DC/OS provide these advantages?

            h3 On-demand provisioning
            p Provisioning the different data services that comprise a fast data pipeline (message queues to track data streams, processing programs, and databases to store results) can be a huge challenge because each service has its own specific requirements. DC/OS abstracts away the details and allows you to provision and run all of these services on a common set of resources with your containerized or legacy app. You can install most data services in the #[a(href='http://universe.dcos.io/#/') DC/OS Universe] (service catalog) with a few clicks from the GUI or commands from the CLI. Because provisioning data services is easy, you can experiment with multiple options, allowing you to optimize your pipeline for speed and performance&mdash;not provisioning time.

            p.pb5 DC/OS can run #[a('https://dcos.io/docs/1.9/deploying-services/gpu/') GPU] consuming data services on the same cluster as CPU consuming services, and supports injecting GPUs into containers. Containerized GPU-based applications compatible with nvidia-docker will run on DC/OS without modification—and users can #[a('https://dcos.io/docs/1.9/deploying-services/gpu/config/') isolate access] to GPUs on a per-container basis.

            h3 Simplified operations
            p If you are processing big data when a server in your data center fails, you have time to reschedule your process. But when you depend on fast data, every second counts. DC/OS's resilient architecture automatically #[a('/docs/1.9/deploying-services/task-handling/') reschedules tasks] that were running on failed nodes.

            p.pb5 Even under normal conditions logging, debugging, and metrics gathering are essential for smooth operations. DC/OS provides easily queryable APIs which will be able to send operational data to your choice of visualization tools.

            h3 Elastic infrastructure
            p Big data is processed in batches, which gives you control over the amount of processing power that you need at any given time. But fast data can be unpredictable, and the amount of processing power you need can vary from moment to moment. DC/OS allows you to scale apps up, down, and out safely. It maximizes server efficiency during peak times, which saves you money and guards against downtime.
