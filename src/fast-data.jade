        h1 Fast Data on DC/OS
        p.hero-subtitle(style='max-width: 46rem;').mb0 Data is collected in real-time from many sources, but up until recently it has been processed after it was collected, in order to find out what had happened in the past. All this data, processed after collection, was called &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. Modern apps, however, need to respond to events as they happen, not to yesterday's news. To do this, they process data as it is collected and provide real-time insights. When data is processed as it is collected, we call it &ldquo;fast data&rdquo;.

            h2 DC/OS enables fast data
            p Implementing a fast data pipeline can enable your modern app do amazing things, but it also poses challenges that aren’t a problem when you’re dealing with big data alone. Building your fast data pipeline&mdash;and the app that it supports&mdash;on top of the Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS) can help alleviate some of these challenges.

            h4 On-demand provisioning
            p Fast data requires many different components, which each have different requirements and prerequisites. DC/OS allows you to provision these components with a single click or command.

            h4 Simplified operations
            p When you rely on fast data, every second counts. You need your fast data pipeline to be more resilient than the infrastructure it runs on, and DC/OS provides that resiliency.

            h3 On-demand provisioning
            p.pb5 Provisioning the different data services that comprise a fast data pipeline (message queues to track data streams, processing programs, and databases to store results) can be a huge challenge, because each has it's own specific requirements. DC/OS abstracts away the details and allows you to provision and run all of these services on a common set of resources with your containerized or legacy app. You can install most data services in the DC/OS universe with a single click in the GUI or single command from the CLI. When provisioning data services is easy, you can experiment with multiple options, allowing you to optimize your pipeline for speed and performance&mdash;not provisioning time.

            h3 Simplified operations
            p.pb5 If you are processing big data when a server in your data center fails, you have time to reschedule your process. But when you depend on fast data, every second counts. DC/OS provides a resilient architecture that automatically reschedules tasks that were running on failed nodes. Even under normal conditions logging, debugging, and metrics gathering are essential for smooth operations. With the release of 1.9, DC/OS will provide easily queryable APIs which will be able to send operational data to your choice of visualization tools.

            h3 Elastic data infrastructure
            p Big data data is processed in batches, which gives you control over the amount of processing power that you need at any given time. But fast data can be unpredictable, and the amount of processing power you need can vary from moment to moment. DC/OS allows you to scale apps up, down, and out safely. It maximizes server efficiency during peak times, which saves you money and guards against downtime.
