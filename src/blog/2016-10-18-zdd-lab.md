Have you ever wondered how exactly to roll out a service without causing downtimes?
Look no further, we have something for you:

The DC/OS [Zero Downtime Deployments lab](https://github.com/mhausenblas/zdd-lab).

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2016-10-18-zddlab.gif" alt="DC/OS rolling upgrade" />

This lab aims at providing an introduction to service deployments by walking you, step-by-step, 
through recipes how to roll out new versions of a DC/OS service without downtimes. We explain the basic 
concepts, such as health checks or [canary](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html) deployments, in
detail and provide instructions along with the necessary configurations. Each section contains a discussion of
the underlying motivation and as well as tips and recommendation when to use what.

We're covering the following topics in the Zero Downtime Deployments lab:

- Rolling upgrades, without and with health checks
- How and when to use readiness checks
- Minimizing overcapacity during deployments
- Canary deployments
- Blue-Green deployments

If you have a DC/OS 1.8 up and running, it should take you roughly 45 min to go through all the exercises.

Give [it a try](https://github.com/mhausenblas/zdd-lab) today and let us know what you think or what is missing!
