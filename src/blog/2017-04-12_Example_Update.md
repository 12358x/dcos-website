# Try DC/OS 1.9 and contribute

As you know, [DC/OS 1.9](/releases/) is out, and the community team needs your help to make sure that all the package examples work with the new version of DC/OS! We will be offering a free t-shirt and major kudos to anyone who updates a package between now and April 26th!

## How to participate

* Pick an issue from the [list of examples](https://github.com/dcos/examples/labels/1.9-migration) to update, and leave a comment to indicate that you're working on it.
* On your own fork of the examples repo, make a copy of the 1.8 example and name it 1.9. Test the example on a [DC/OS 1.9 cluster](/docs/1.9/administration/installing/). As you test, replace the old screen shots with new ones and make any necessary corrections to the example. Add a link to your newly created 1.9 example to the `README.md` file for your example's directory.
    * If the example works out of the box, or you are able to correct it, open a PR to add your new 1.9 example (including the example itself and its addition to the `README.md` file).
    * If you can't get your example to work, add a detailed description of what went wrong on the GitHub issue.
* When you're done, email community-team@dcos.io with the following info:
    * Subject: 1.9 Example Testing - Service Name
    * Body:
        * Your name
        * PR link (or issue link if your example is broken)
        * Your shirt size (we have both women's and men's sizes)
        * Your Twitter handle if you have one
        * Shipping address (we can ship internationally)

## Get a free t-shirt

Ravi, JÃ¶rg, and Elizabeth will test your example to make sure it works (or review your issue report), and then we'll send out your shirt! Simple as that.

This is a great opportunity to get familiar with DC/OS 1.9, and we look forward to your PRs! As always, if you have any questions please feel free to ask by emailing [community-team@dcos.io](mailto:community-team@dcos.io)
