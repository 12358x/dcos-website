When did you know that you want to be a software developer? Some people I’ve met have known exactly what they wanted to do early in their childhood. However, for me it came a bit later. As far as I can remember, I was in 8th grade when I took up a course in programming languages. I didn’t really know what I was doing as I copied code off the answer sheet that the teacher had given, but I was elated when I fixed a missing semicolon and watched “Hello World” print on screen.

## From Printing Hello World to Developer Evangelism
After college graduation, I started working on writing device drivers for a healthcare company, where I first met a group of passionate hackers teaching each other and working together on projects. It was crazy to see ideas become reality in mere hours. I had so much to learn, but now I was doing that with other people. The group inspired me to go out and present at conferences, learn from, and inspire other developers to build amazing things.

I was indebted to this community and, I wanted to give back by helping developers, both current and aspiring. Recently, I have been mentoring students at Code Tenderloin to help them prototype their ideas and possibly become entrepreneurs.

My name is Ravi Yadav and I have joined the Partner Engineering / Developer Advocacy crew at Mesosphere in San Francisco. I cherish spending my time with the members of the developer community and I look forward to doing that with members of the [DC/OS community][dcos-community].

I want to open up a two way street here. Not only do I want to use the relevant opportunities to educate and inspire developers on new features in DC/OS and best practices on writing services for it, I also want to use this opportunity to listen to all of you. We have multiple  channels available both online and offline. Online, we have the [DC/OS Slack group][slack], [mailing list][mail], weekly office hours and  we are also listening on [Twitter][twitter]. In the offline world we run and work with several [Meetup][meetup] groups and [conferences][events].

## Let’s make the **Universe** amazing!

[Universe][Universe] is a marketplace of services which run on DC/OS. These services (like Spark or Cassandra) can be installed with defaults or customized directly in the web UI.

If you’re a community member or a partner and have any ideas or suggestions on what services you want to see on Universe,  reach out to me and I will make sure you’re heard.

If you have a service which you would like to see deployed on DC/OS, I will work with you to get  it added in Universe. https://mesosphere.com/partners

If this is the first time you heard about DC/OS or want to make your first open source contribution, I will get you set up for that.
I’m here to help.
