DockerCon is right around the corner. We'll be there sharing space with the Mesosphere booth. Stop by and say hi, we'd love to meet you in person.

If you'd like to hang out with the rest of the community, come by the Mesosphere booth around 6:00 PM on Monday (during happy hour time). After awhile, we'll go find somewhere more comfortable and get to know each other.
