We’re very excited to announce the availability of *DC/OS 1.8 Early Access*! This is the first major release since we open sourced DC/OS a few months ago, and we couldn’t be happier with the level of community engagement and support that made this release a reality.

Please note that this is an *Early Access* release. There are some rough edges and missing documentation. Take it for a [test drive][releases], [file some bugs][jira], but be aware that it may be a bumpy ride!

This release includes all kinds of new things, including:

- Integrated Container Orchestration with Jobs and Services
- Built-in Overlay Networking
- Mesos 1.0

Check out the [release notes][notes] to learn more about the newest features, or watch our video from this week’s [DC/OS Office Hours][office_hours] with Mesosphere’s VP Engineering, Tal Broda, to see some of them in action.

We need your help. Please give this [EA version of 1.8][releases] a try and help us iron out any remaining issues. You can log a [JIRA][jira] ticket if you find any bugs, or join our [Slack][slack] community if you have any questions. We’ll be waiting for you in the #general channel.

Thanks everyone - greatly appreciate your help.
