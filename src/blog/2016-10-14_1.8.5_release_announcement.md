Weâ€™re excited to tell you that 1.8.5 is out and that you can read about it or give it a test drive [here](https://dcos.io/releases/1.8.5/). 1.8.5 includes a few fixes:
* HTTP Proxy is now fixed. For more information, see the [documentation](https://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/installing/custom/configure-proxy/).
* CORE-632 - Fixes for log rotation in Mesos.
* DCOS-9966 - Improved error messages are printed for NTP service startup check.

To ask questions about any of the fixes, please find us on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/dcos.io/forum/#!forum/users) or [Slack](http://chat.dcos.io/). As always, we really appreciate [bug reporting](https://jira.dcos.io/secure/Dashboard.jspa) and [contributions](https://dcos.io/contribute/)!
