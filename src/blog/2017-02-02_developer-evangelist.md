At the beginning of January, I joined Mesosphere as a DC/OS Developer Advocate, joining Michael Hausenblas, Jörg Schad and Judith Malnick in efforts to grow the DC/OS user and developer community.

I became involved with my first open source group in 2002 as a volunteer for the [Philadelphia Linux Users Group](http://www.phillylinux.org/). By 2007 I was coordinating the group and had made my first major contributions to several open source projects, working on packaging for [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and taking on various community tasks for [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/). I had also taken my first position as a Linux Systems Administrator.

I spent six years on the [Ubuntu Community Council](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil) (one of the two governing bodies of the Ubuntu project), and in 2013 I was hired by Hewlett-Packard as a Linux Systems Engineer to help run the [OpenStack Project Infrastructure](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/), which included a fully open source Continuous Integration (CI) system. Through these roles, I have learned a lot about growing and listening to the needs of a global community, both as a volunteer and a paid contributor.

Over the past decade I have found value in regularly attending [Community Leadership Summits](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/) (CLS) where members of various communities---open source and otherwise---gather to share knowledge about community building. Most recently, I attended one of the satellite CLSx events in Hobart, Tasmania during [Linux.conf.au](https://linux.conf.au/) (LCA), and summarized our discussions about recognition of community members, community metrics and more on my personal blog: [CLSx at LCA 2017](http://princessleia.com/journal/2017/01/clsx-at-lca-2017/). I regularly speak at open source events about how to listen to your community by reading between the lines, to understand what they need but aren't directly requesting. At [FOSSCON](http://fosscon.org/) in Philadelphia in August I gave a keynote titled “Listening to the needs of your global open source community”, which I repeated at LCA and will give again at the upcoming [SCALE15x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/15x) in Pasadena, California.

Today I'm passionate about creating as much transparency as possible for open source communities. From broad software direction decisions to the intricacies of the CI system, I want community members to have as much visibility as possible into their projects. To promote transparency, I’m running an [Open Source Infrastructure Day](http://scale.opensourceinfra.org/) on March 2nd (co-located with SCALE15x) where members of various projects will share strategies for running project infrastructures in the open.

I’ve already learned a lot about the DC/OS community on [Slack](http://chat.dcos.io/?_ga=1.263299084.186147938.1483478639) and the [user mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/dcos.io/d/forum/users), and I'm excited to see the growth of new [Working Groups](https://github.com/dcos/community#dcos-community) and Meetups (including the regular [DC/OS Online Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DC-OS-Online-Meetup/)), some of which lead by DC/OS users in our community. I’m looking forward to helping these outlets expand and flourish, and creating new opportunities for interested community members to get involved with DC/OS.

So if you see me at an open source conference in the coming months, please say “Hello!” and encourage me dig some stickers out of my bag. I'm excited to work with anyone interested in getting involved with DC/OS to find the information you need to excel, and to work with Mesosphere engineers to make DC/OS development crystal clear. I’m available at ejoseph@dcos.io, I’m ejoseph.mesosphere on the DC/OS [Slack](http://chat.dcos.io/?_ga=1.263299084.186147938.1483478639) and I tweet about open source projects I work on, communities, travel and my cats on Twitter as [@pleia2](https://twitter.com/pleia2).
