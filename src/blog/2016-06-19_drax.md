I assume that you've heard of Netflix's [Chaos Monkey](http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html)? It seems that chaos-based resilience testing is becoming increasingly popular these days, especially in the context of containers and folks have been [asking for a Mesos-specific](https://www.mail-archive.com/user@mesos.apache.org/msg05964.html) tool as well. 

Now, the other day I get a mail from Flo, our CEO, asking me what the effort would be and if I could take care of it. Given that both the community *and* my CEO seems to think that's a good thing to have I thought: well, let's give it a try.

The result is now available and I decided to name it after a Guardians of the Galaxy character (because I like Marvel) who exposes certain (in this context desirable) properties, namely his destructive manners. Meet DRAX, a DC/OS-specific resilience testing tool that works mainly on the task/ container level.

In a nutshell, DRAX runs as a Marathon app, killing off random tasks of any (non-framework) or specific (non-framework) application running in Marathon. Why this limitation to Marathon? Simple: this sort of testing is mainly interesting for long-running apps, so exactly what Marathon is used for to run.

Enough talk, let's see DRAX in action.

## In action

All you have to do to get started is either clone the GitHub repo [dcos-labs/drax](https://github.com/dcos-labs/drax) or simply download DRAX's [app spec](https://github.com/dcos-labs/drax/blob/master/marathon-drax.json) and you can launch DRAX like so (assuming you've got a DC/OS 1.7 cluster and the CLI installed):

```bash
$ dcos marathon app add marathon-drax.json
```
Once that is done you should see DRAX running in Marathon an ready to [rampage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts4u6tPVZA4):

A concrete rampage, targeting any app, looks as follows:

```bash
$ http POST $PUBLIC_AGENT:7777/rampage
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 121
Content-Type: application/javascript
Date: Mon, 13 Jun 2016 12:15:19 GMT

{"success":true,"goners":["webserver.0fde0035-315f-11e6-aad0-1e9bbbc1653f","dummy.11a7c3bb-315f-11e6-aad0-1e9bbbc1653f"]}
```

BTW, no worries, DRAX is smart enough not to target itself.

## Next steps

This is only the beginning. I'd love to hear feedback, either via the [DC/OS Community Slack](http://chat.dcos.io) or directly by [raising an issue](https://github.com/dcos-labs/drax/issues) on the repo. What would you like to see next? Node-level rampages ala Chaos Monkey? Or maybe taking down an entire cluster to simulate a DR scenario? Network partitions? I'd appreciate if you use DRAX and let me know what sucks and what rocks. Thanks for your time and hope to hear from you!
