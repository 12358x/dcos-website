At Mesosphere we are a user-centered design company. As regularly as possible **our Product Design team connects with users to run usability tests on new DC/OS features** and conduct interviews on potential future features we intend to build. Our goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data, and determine your satisfaction with DC/OS.

User testing sessions typically last **one hour**. We'll show you both new features we've built, or prototypes of features we're thinking of building, then ask you to complete a few tasks to see if they make sense. **You get to see what we're working on** and it also gives you a chance to **be part of our product development process** by offering early feedback that we can incorporate.

You can easily be involved either **in-person or remotely**. Just <a href="http://uxresearch.mesosphere.com">fill out our UX Research form</a> and you will receive notifications about any upcoming testing sessions we're hosting. You'll be able to pick a time that suits you and **we offer swag and gift card incentives** as a thank you.
