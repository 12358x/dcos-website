# What is Day 2 Ops?

In his [blog post](http://technoblogic.io/blog/2016/09/19/day2-logging/) on the subject, Jeff Malnick (the leader of the Day 2 Operations working group) describes Day 2 Ops in the following way:

"It takes more to run an application in production than installing some software and starting applications. For the operator, their job truly begins on day 2---maintaining, upgrading, debugging a running cluster without downtime.

Since DC/OS is an operating system, we have the perfect platform to build the APIs and functionality required for operators to be successful and efficient at their jobs. Some of the first pieces of this functionality that we are focused on here is logging, metrics and debugging."

# Scope

The Day 2 Operations working group is focused on topics that relate to operations: specifically logging, monitoring, and debugging to start. (We may eventually, as a group, choose to break the Day 2 Operations working group out into several, more specialized groups. But weâ€™ll see if that makes sense once the group gets off the ground.)
