# No changes since 1.10.2

An emergency Enterprise 1.10.3 release was shipped on December 12th, 2017 to patch a security bug in an Enterprise DC/OS component, which is not used in open source. We'll be skipping open source version 1.10.3 to keep the open and Enterprise  versions in sync with each other, but there is no open source 1.10.3 release.

All the changes planned for 1.10.3 will now land in 1.10.4, which you will be able to upgrade to directly from 1.10.2. If you're running open source DC/OS 1.10.2 you're still on the most recent version of DC/OS. Enjoy!
