# No changes since 1.10.2

A patch release of DC/OS Enterprise 1.10.3 was shipped on December 12th, 2017 to fix a bug in an Enterprise DC/OS component. We'll be skipping open source version 1.10.3 to keep the open and Enterprise versions in sync with each other; there is no open source 1.10.3 release.

 All the changes planned for 1.10.3 will now land in 1.10.4, which you will be able to upgrade to directly from 1.10.2. If you're running open source DC/OS 1.10.2 you'll be using the most recent version of DC/OS until the release of 1.10.4.
