## Contributing code

Overall, the process to contribute code to DC/OS is modelled after the [ASF process](https://community.apache.org/contributors/) with a strong emphasis on individual contributors. The following are the four pillars of the DC/OS governance:

(1) Everyone who uses DC/OS is a contributor and is encouraged to provide feedback on the usage of DC/OS, for example by raising a [Jira](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/) ticket or via [Slack](http://chat.dcos.io).

(2) Any contributor can also eventually be selected as a committer, with the difference that a committer has push access to all the DC/OS repos.

(3) The administration of the project, including the GitHub organization [github.com/dcos](https://github.com/dcos) as well as project-related resources including Jira and mailing lists, is handled by the DC/OS **Project Management Committee** (PMC). The members of the PMC (as of 01/2017) are: Aaron Williams, Ben Hindman, Sebastien Pahl, Tal Broda, Thomas Rampelberg (Chair), and Vinod Kone. You can reach out to the PMC via [dcos-pmc@dcos.io](mailto:dcos-pmc@dcos.io).

(4) A dedicated Github organization called  [github.com/dcos-labs](https://github.com/dcos-labs) provides a sandboxed environment for new or experimental projects. Any DC/OS contributor can ask to add a project in dcos-labs if they have a champion from the PMC.
