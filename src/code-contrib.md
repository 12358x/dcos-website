## Contributing code

Overall, the process to contribute code to DC/OS is modelled after the [ASF process](https://community.apache.org/contributors/) with a strong emphasis on individual contributors. The following are the six pillars of the DC/OS governance:

(1) Everyone who uses DC/OS is a contributor and is encouraged to provide feedback on the usage of DC/OS, for example by raising a [Jira](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/) ticket or via [Slack](http://chat.dcos.io).

(2) Any contributor can also eventually be selected as a committer, with the difference that a committer has push access to all the DC/OS repos.

(3) The administration of the project, including the GitHub organization [github.com/dcos](https://github.com/dcos) as well as project-related resources including Jira and mailing lists, is handled by the DC/OS **Project Management Committee** (PMC). The initial members of the PMC (as of 05/2016) are: Aaron Williams, Thomas Rampelberg, and Michael Hausenblas with further members being nominated in the coming weeks. Note that you can reach out to the PMC via [pmc@dcos.io](mailto:pmc@dcos.io).

(4) Each project within DC/OS has a **Project Management Team** (PMT), consisting of the initial committers from Mesosphere, as donated to the project on 2016-04-19. The infrastructure each PMT is equipped with is initially limited to the project GitHub repo as well as a component in [Jira](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/).

(5) Each PMT nominates one member to participate on the PMC. This individual will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks in the project.

(6) For any new, experimental projects a dedicated Github organization called  [github.com/dcos-labs](https://github.com/dcos-labs) is used to provide a sandboxed environment to foster adoption. Every DC/OS contributor can request a project to be put into the incubator if she has a champion from one of the PMTs or the PMC.
