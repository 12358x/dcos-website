By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.

        p This Privacy Policy covers the use of information collected through our Website or Services. Our treatment of information or data from your use of any Mesosphere products other than the Services (for example, DCOS Community Edition) is subject to a separate agreement between you and Mesosphere.

        p Remember that your use of Mesosphere’s Services is at all times subject to the #[a(href='https://dcos.io/tos/') Terms of Use (dcos.io/tos)], which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any capitalized terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the  #[a(href='https://dcos.io/tos/') Terms of Use (dcos.io/tos)].

        h2 What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
        p This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.

        p As noted in the #[a(href='https://dcos.io/tos/') Terms of Use (dcos.io/tos)], we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at #[a(href='mailto:help@dcos.io') help@dcos.io].

        h3 Will Mesosphere ever change this Privacy Policy?
        p We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

        h3 What Information does Mesosphere Collect?

        p Information You Provide to Us:

        p We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process, we may collect Personal Information such as your name and email address. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our Services. We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in those communications and following the instructions.

        p Information Collected Automatically

        p Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.

        p We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services — for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.

We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.

        p Affiliated Businesses:

        p In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).

In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred or subject to routine due diligence activities. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.

        p Protection of Mesosphere and Others:

        p We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our #[a(href='https://dcos.io/tos/') Terms of Use (dcos.io/tos)] and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Mesosphere, our employees, our users, or others.
